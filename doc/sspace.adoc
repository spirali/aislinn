****
This document demonstrates a construction of a state space for a simple MPI program.

We are going to analyze the following code:

[source, c, linenums]
----
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int rank;

    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);

    if (rank == 0) {
        int *mem1 = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int) * 2);
        int *mem2 = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
        int data;
        MPI_Recv(&data, 1, MPI_INT, MPI_ANY_SOURCE, 1,
        MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
        mem1[data] = 10;
        MPI_Recv(&data, 1, MPI_INT, MPI_ANY_SOURCE, 1,
        MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
        mem2[data] = 10;
        free(mem1);
        free(mem2);
    }

    if (rank == 1 || rank == 2) {
        MPI_Ssend(&rank, 1, MPI_INT, 0, 1,
        MPI_COMM_WORLD);
    }

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}

In this program, process 0 waits for two messages from any source and processes 1 and 2 send messages to process 0. 
If the message from process 1 is received first, then no error occurs. 
If the message from process 2 is received first, then process 0 writes into an invalid memory at line 16.

The following picure shows a state-space graph computed by Aislinn for our program:

Nodes are global states of the verified application. They are "snapshots" of a current memory content and CPU registers of each process, together with a state of MPI, e.g. messages that are transported between processes. 
An arc represents a run of the program between two global states. 
It may generally represent a computation in more processes until the program does not arrive to an "important" state.
It is a terminal state or a state where are more possible continuations.
In this moment, states of all processes are captured and the tool checks if an equivalent state was not already discovered by another execution path.
If the state already exists, then the execution of the current path is terminated; therefore, already processed nodes are not recomputed again.

The first arc between global states 0 and 1 represents initialization of all processes until `MPI_Init` (line 7).
The arc between global states 1 and 2 represents a computation in all three processes. Therefore, all three local states are changed. The arc between 2 and 3 modifies only the state of process 0, hence process 1 and process 2 are unchanged.
In state 2, there are two choices how the program may evolve; the message from process 1 is received (the arc to state 3) or the message from process 2 is received (the arc to state 4). 
During an execution of each arc, correctness of the computation is checked.
Therefore, the tool is able to discover the problem of the invalid memory writing that happens during the execution of the arc from node 5.
