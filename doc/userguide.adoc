.Overview
****

* _Aislinn_ is a dynamic verifier for MPI programs.
    For a fixed input it checks all possible runs with respect to nondeterminism introduced
    by MPI.

* _Aislinn_ operates directly on an unmodified C/C++ code.

* _Aislinn_ detects problems like invalid memory accesses, misuse of MPI,
    and resource leaks.

* _Aislinn_ is released under GPLv2.

****

== What kind of problems can Aislinn find?

Let us assume the following MPI program (executed on 3 processes):

[source, c, linenums]
----
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	int rank;

	MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
	MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);

	if (rank == 0) {
		int *mem1 = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int) * 2);
		int *mem2 = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
		int data;
		MPI_Recv(&data, 1, MPI_INT, MPI_ANY_SOURCE, 1, 
			MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
		mem1[data] = 10;
		MPI_Recv(&data, 1, MPI_INT, MPI_ANY_SOURCE, 1, 
			MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
		mem2[data] = 10;
		free(mem1);
		free(mem2);
	}

	if (rank == 1 || rank == 2) {
		MPI_Send(&rank, 1, MPI_INT, 0, 1, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
	}

	MPI_Finalize();
	return 0;
}
----

The program does the following: process 0 receives two messages from anyone and
processes 1 and 2 send a message to process 0. If a message from process 1 is
received first, then the run is valid. If a message from process 2 is received
first, then invalid memory write occurs at line 16. If we are unlucky during
testing, it may happen that we will see only the first valid case. Hence all
our tests pass even there is a problem.

Aislinn always finds the problem and reports an invalid memory write in this
application. It is possible because it does not check only a single run, but
all possible behavior of the application (with respect to nondetermism of
MPI).

The current version can find the following problems:

* Invalid memory reads and writes
* Touching a memory provided to nonblocking MPI operation
* Invalid arguments of MPI calls
* Memory leaks, MPI resource leaks
* Deadlocks
* Non-unique write on standard output
  (If your program should always write the same thing in all runs)

== What programs can be verified?

* Aislinn verifies MPI program written in C/C++.

* The current version supports many commonly used calls from MPI-2 and MPI-3
  related to point-to-point communication, collective communication, and
  communicator management.
  Unfortunately, MPI-IO and one-side communication is not implemented yet.
  One of the main goals of the further development is to support almost all MPI
  calls.

* Source codes that contain MPI have to be translated by Aislinn version of
  `mpicc`; other source files do not have to be compiled by Aislinn.

* The program state has to be fully described by its memory content and state
  of MPI, e. g. program cannot communicate in other way than MPI. Reading files
  or writing files is ok, until the program does not writes something into a file
  and then reads it back in a single run.

* _(limitation of the current version)_
  A verified program cannot call MPI communication routines between file manipulations.
  But it is ok to read the input, make an MPI computation and then write results.

* Aislinn does not support multi-threaded applications. Each MPI process has
  to have a single thread.


== Installation

IMPORTANT: Aislinn works only on *Linux x86-64* in the current version.

=== Requirements

Aislinn depends on the following software:

 * Valgrind (a modified version, described below)
 * Python 2.6+
 * jinja2
 * Matplotlib (optional, not necessary for a normal usage)

=== Installation steps

The installation steps to install development version of Aislinn:

Clone the repository with Aislinn:

    $ git clone https://github.com/spirali/aislinn

Go to the directory with Aislinn:

    $ cd aislinn

Clone the repository with a modified version of Valgrind:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/spirali/aislinn-valgrind valgrind

Build Valgrind

    $ cd valgrind
    $ sh autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ cd ..

Build Aislinn

    $ ./waf configure
    $ ./waf

That is all.

The following text assumes that Aislinn's `bin` was added into system
PATH like this:

    $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/aislinn/bin/

NOTE: If you later update a repository with Aislinn, do not forget to update
also Valgrind repository and run `make` in it.

=== Optional: Installation into the system

Aislinn can be used directly from the directory `aislinn` where it was
compiled.  However it can be also installed into the system. We recommed to
setup **prefix** to prevent overwriting system Valgrind with Aislinn-specific
Valgrind.

To install Aislinn with prefix run the following commands:

    $ cd valgrind
    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/prefix
    $ ./make install
    $ cd ..
    $ ./waf configure --prefix=/path/to/prefix
    $ ./waf install

== The first run

Let assume that we have a source file `main.c` that contains our
MPI application. First, it has to be compiled with Aislinn:

    $ aislinn-cc -g main.c -o myprogram

Script `aislinn-cc` just calls `gcc` with modified include paths.  The
parameter `-g` is an option of `gcc` that adds debugging symbols. It allows to
provide more precise error messages. Beside `aislinn-cc`, there is also
`aislinn-c++` for C++ programs.

NOTE: There are also symlinks  `mpicc` and `mpicxx` to `aislinn-cc` and
`aislin-c++` in `bin` directory, hence Aislinn can directly serve as a
replacement for an MPI implementation.

NOTE: You have to compile only source files that contain MPI functions;
other source files or libraries do not have to be compiled by Aislinn

A compiled program can be verified by running `aislinn`:

    $ aislinn -p=4 ./myprogram

where **-p=4** says that an execution with four MPI processes are examined.
When analysis is finished, it produces a report into file `report.html`.
More options are described in Section <<_aislinn_options>>.

== How Aislinn works?

This section gives a brief overview how Aislinn internally works. 
It should give a better understanding of some configuration options, some
information in reports, and rationalization of some limitations.  I have tried
to design the tool in a way, that the user does not need this knowledge and in
most cases it should be sufficient to use the tool as it is described in
Chapter <<_the_first_run>> without additional knowledge.

Aislinn is based on state-space analysis, i. e. it builds a graph of all
relevant behavior.  As an example we take the C program from the first chapter. 

To make the explanation easier, two things are simplified:

* We start to think about program when all processes already called
`MPI_Init`. The situation before `MPI_Init` is treated in a slightly different
way and it is not important for this explanation.
* We assume that our send is synchronous to avoid explaining full semantics
of `MPI_Send`.  (In other words, we have replaced `MPI_Send` by `MPI_SSend` in
the example.)

When a verification of a program is started, Aislinn starts to build a
graph of relevant behaviors -- ``state space''. It is created by executing a
program in a controlled environment. When there are more possibilities how a
situation can be resolved, Aislinn repeatedly returns the program back to this state
and systematically tries all variants.  The following state space is created for
our example:

image::statespace.png[]

Nodes of the state space are global states of the verified application.  They
can be seen as ``snapshots'' of a memory content and CPU registers of each
process, together with a state of MPI, e.g. messages that are transported
between processes.  An arc is a run of the program between two consecutive MPI
calls that may have a global effect.

The initial state is a state where all processes are in a situation directly
after leaving of `MPI_Init` (line 7).  The first arc represents a computation
in process 0, an execution of code between `MPI_Init` and the first `MPI_Recv`.
The arc between states 2 and 3 is a computation in process 1 between `MPI_Init`
and `MPI_Send`. The next arc between states 3 and 4 means the same for process
2.  In state 4, there are two choices how can our program proceed; the message
from process 1 is received (the arc between states 4 and 5) or the message from
process 2 is received (the arc between states 4 and 6). When Aislinn
discovers a state that was already processed, then an execution of this branch
is terminated.

Aislinn creates the whole state space by this approach.  During an execution
of each arc, correctness is checked. Therefore the tool is able to discover
the problem with an invalid memory write that happens during execution the arc
between node 4 and 6.

There is a natural question, why our state space does contain all executions.
For example, process 0 could receive the message from process 1 before the
process 2 sends its own message; it would spawn a new branch from state 3. Such
execution is possible in our program, but it can be proven that it is not
necessary to verify this path, because if there is an error then it will be
discovered also in other paths.  Aislinn uses
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_order_reduction[Partial order reduction]
techniques. It is used to prove that some executions are ``covered'' by the
rest of the state space.  It allows us to safely remove some paths from a state
space (and speed up the verification) and still be able detect all errors.

== Aislinn options

=== Synopsis

    aislinn [options] your-program [your-program-options]

=== Main options

**-p N**

Specify a number of processes for which the program will be verified. (default: 1)

**--heap-size=SIZE**

Set maximal size of heap for the verified program in bytes. Suffixes K, M, and
G can be used to specify the size in kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, e.g.
`--heap-size=50M`

**--max-states=COUNT**

Set a maximal number of states in a state space. (default: 9999999)

**--redzone-size=SIZE**

Set size of minimal memory padding that separates each allocation. 
It allows to detect underrun and overrun up to SIZE bytes. (default: 16)

**--report-type=TYPE**

Set the output format for reports. Possible values are:

* _html_ - A human readable report in html (default)
* _xml_  - An XML report for additional processing
* _html+xml_ - Create both reports
* _none_ - No report is written

**-S PROTOCOL**, **--send-protocol=PROTOCOL**

Set the send protocol of standard sends. (default: _full_)

* _full_ - The full semantics according MPI standard.

* _eager_ - All standard sends are considered as buffered sends; it can speed up
  the verification. All errors inside processes will be reported as for _full_
  semantics, but it is possible that some deadlocks are missed.

* _rendezvous_ - All standard sends are considered as synchronous sends;
  it can speed up the verification. You should see almost all deadlocks but it
  is possible to miss some errors inside processes.

* X (X is integer) - It allows to specify a behavior according to the size of the
  message. If the size of a message is lower than X then a buffered send is
  used, otherwise a synchronous send is used.

* X:Y (X and Y are integers) - Similar to the previous option. If the size of
  the message is lower than X then a buffered send is used, if the size is
bigger than Y then a synchronous send is used, otherwise the full semantics are
applied (i.e. both options are considered).

Suffixes K, M, and G can be used to specify the size in kilobytes, megabytes,
and gigabytes in the last two options.

**--verbose=LEVEL**

Set verbosity level. (default: 1)

* 0 - show only errors
* 1 - show INFO messages
* 2 - show all messages including DEBUG messages

=== Stream options

**--stderr=MODE**

Set how to treat standard error output of the verified application. Possible
values: _capture_, _print_, _drop_, _stdout_ (default: capture). The first
three options have the same meaning as in the case of **--stdout** option.  When
mode _stdout_ is used then standard error output is redirected to standard
output and then a mode of **--stdout** is applied.

**--stderr-write=N**

It is analogous to **--stdout-write** but for standard error output.
Outputs are saved into files with names `stderr-<pid>-<x>`.

**--stdout=MODE**

Set how to treat standard output of the verified application. (default:
capture)

* _capture_ - Standard output is captured and processed by Aislinn as a part of
  the state space, i.e. when an error occurs, Aislinn can show a corresponding
  output of an invalid run.
* _print_ - Standard output is ignored by Aislinn and it is normally processed
  by an application as usual. Note: During a state space analysis, parts of the
  verified application can be run several times or run in different orders.
  Therefore the output can be quite different from a normal output of the
  application.
* _drop_ - Standard output of the verified application is discarded.

**--stdout-write=N**

When used, it saves the first N possible outputs that may application write on
standard output. N can be set to value "all" to obtain all outputs.
Outputs are saved into files with names `stdout-<pid>-<x>`.

**--profile**

Aislinn tracks counts of processed instructions and allocations and shows
possible outcomes in the report.

=== Semi-internal options

These options allow to configure or get information about the verification
process.  It may be useful to debug the verified application, but it also
needs some insight into Aislinn.

**--search=TYPE**

Set a search algorithm to go through the state space. (default: bfs)

* _bfs_ - Bread-first search
* _dfs_ - Depth-first search

**--stats=N**

Memory-related statistics are saved every N discovered states. Results are
written into the report.  (This option requires installed *matplotlib*)

**--write-dot**

Write a resulting state space into file `statespace.dot` (graphviz format).

=== Internal options

The following options are considered as internal and they are used for debugging
Aislinn itself.

**--debug-profile**

**--debug-by-valgrind-tool=TOOL**

**--vgv=LEVEL**

Set verbosity level of valgrind tool. (default: 0)

**--debug-state=UID**

**--debug-compare-states=STATE~STATE**

**--debug-statespace**

**--debug-vglogfile=PREFIX**

Writes stdout and stderr of vgclients into files with a given PREFIX

== Aislinn and PETSc

If you want to verify a program that uses http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/[_Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific
Computation_] (PETSc), proceed as follows:

* Download and unpack a distribution tarball of PETSc.

* Run the configure command; modify `path/to/aislinn` to your real path where Aislinn is installed.

    $ ./configure --with-mpi-dir=/path/to/aislinn --with-mpiuni-fortran-binding=false --with-shared-libraries=0 

* Compile your program as usual against this version of PETSc.

* Use `aislinn` instead of `mpirun`.
